This is a resubmission of the package densiter under a new name, which was first submitted to CRAN a couple of days ago.

I have implemented the CRAN comments and renamed the package to densitr, the following issues were implemented as suggested by the CRAN reviewer:

- Stasia Grinberg was added to contributors.
- The title was changed as suggested, omitting "Tools" and adding reference about trees.
- There is no publication describing the methods yet, I will add it once I publish it.
- Examples for unexported functions were removed.
- The \dontrun{} were replaced with \donttest{} in the relevant examples to avoid taking > 5 seconds.
- Changes to par were either removed or on.exit() is called to restore previous par setting.


Tested on:
* win-builder (devel and release)
* local Fedora R-release
* Fedora R-devel.

R CMD check results:
There were no errors, warnings or notes.
