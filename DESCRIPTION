Description: Provides various tools for analysing density profiles
    obtained by resistance drilling. It can load individual or multiple
    files and trim the starting and ending part of each density profile.
    It also provides tools to trim profiles manually, to detrend the
    measurements using several methods and to plot the profiles. Written
    with a focus on forestry use of resistance drilling in standing trees.
